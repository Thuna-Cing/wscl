Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the dictionary entry
  for the functions MAPC, MAPCAR, MAPCAN, MAPL, MAPLIST, and MAPCON
  contains the phrase "RESULT-TYPE specifies the type of the resulting
  SEQUENCE".  But, unlike the sequence function MAP, these functions
  do not take an argument for specifying the result type.  Each one of
  them returns a list.

Proposal:

  Remove the phrase "RESULT-TYPE specifies the type of the resulting
  SEQUENCE." from the dictionary entry.

Test cases:

  Not applicable.

Rationale:

  The functions specified in this dictionary entry do not take an
  argument for specifying the result type.  The offending phrase was
  likely copied from the dictionary entry for the sequence function
  MAP.

Current practice:

  Not applicable.

Cost to implementors:

  None.

Cost to users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  Programmers reading the dictionary entry for these functions can be
  confused by the phrase mentioning result type.

Benefits:

  Eliminate possible confusion for programmers reading the relevant
  dictionary entry.

Aesthetics:

  The quality of the description of the functions is improved.

Discussion:

  Not required.
