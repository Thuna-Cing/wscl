Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the descriptions of
  DEFVAR and DEFPARAMETER do not specify which binding is affected
  when the specified initial value is assigned.

  For DEFVAR, it is not specified which binding is affected (if any)
  in case no initial value is supplied.

Test Case:

  (defparameter *foo* 1)
  (list (let ((*foo* 2))
          (defparameter *foo* 3)
          *foo*)
        *foo*)

  (defvar *bar* 1)
  (list (let ((*bar* 2))
          (defvar *bar*)
          *bar*)
        *bar*)

Proposal (DEFPARAMETER-NON-TOPLEVEL-SEMANTICS:TOPLEVEL):

  Under this proposal, the above test cases would evaluate to (2 3)
  and (? ?) respectively.

Proposal (DEFPARAMETER-NON-TOPLEVEL-SEMANTICS:LEXICAL):

  Under this proposal, The above test case would evaluate to (3 1) and
  (? 1) respectively.
