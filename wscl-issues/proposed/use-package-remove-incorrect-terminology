Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the description of the
  function USE-PACKAGE contains the phrase "use-package checks for
  name conflicts between the newly imported symbols and those already
  accessible in package".  However, use-package does not "import" any
  symbols, because "import" means to "make the symbol be present in
  the package", and the description of use-package states that
  "use-package does not cause any new symbols to be present in package
  but only makes them accessible by inheritance". 

Proposal (USE-PACKAGE-REMOVE-INCORRECT-TERMINOLOGY:NO-IMPORT):

  This proposal changes the description of the use-package function,
  so that the phrase "use-package checks for name conflicts between
  the newly imported symbols and those already accessible in package"
  is replaced by:

  "use-package checks for name conflicts between the symbols about to
  be made accessible and those already accessible in package".

Rationale:

  The current phrase uses "import" informally, but since this is a
  term with a clear definition in the glossary, the term should not be
  used informally this way.

Cost to Implementors:

  None.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  Confusion concerning the use of terminology that may result in
  additional cost for implementors and users.

Benefits:

  More consistent terminology.

Aesthetics:

  Improved thanks to more consistent terminology.

Discussion:

  TODO
