Issue:        DEFPARAMETER-NON-TOPLEVEL-SEMANTICS
Forum:        Cleanup
Category:     CLARIFICATION
Status:       proposed
Edit History: 21-Jun-21, Version 1 by Jan Moringen
Reference:    DEFVAR, DEFPARAMETER

Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the descriptions of
  DEFVAR and DEFPARAMETER do not specify which binding is affected
  when the specified initial value is assigned.

Test Case:

  (defparameter *foo* 1)
  (list (let ((*foo* 2))
          (defparameter *foo* 3)
          *foo*)
        *foo*)

  (defparameter *foo* 1)
  (list (let ((*foo* 2))
          (defparameter *foo*)
          *foo*)
        *foo*)

Proposal (SLOT-VALUE-MISSING-SETF:TOPLEVEL):

  Under this proposal, the above test cases would evaluate to (2 2)
  and (? ?) respectively.

Proposal (SLOT-VALUE-MISSING-SETF:LEXICAL):

  Under this proposal, The above test case would evaluate to (3 1) and
  (? 1) respectively.
