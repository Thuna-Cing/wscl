Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, figure 2-2 in section
  2.1.2 mentions the dynamic variables that influence the Lisp
  reader.  However, the variables *READ-BASE* and  *FEATURES* also
  influence the Lisp reader, but these variables are not mentioned in
  figure 2-2.

Proposal (ADD-VARIABLES-THAT-INFLUENCE-THE-LISP-READER):

  This proposal adds the variables *READ-BASE* and *FEATURES* to
  figure 2-2.

Test cases:

  Not applicable.

Rationale:

  We think it is a simple omission that these variables are not
  mentioned in figure 2-2.

Current practice:

  Not applicable.

Cost to implementors:

  None.

Cost to users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  Implementors may fail to take into account the missing variables
  when implementing the reader.

Benefits:

  Implementors have a complete list of variables that influence the
  Lisp reader.

Aesthetics:

  It is preferable to have a complete, rather than partial, list of
  variables that influence the Lisp reader.

Discussion:

  Not required.
