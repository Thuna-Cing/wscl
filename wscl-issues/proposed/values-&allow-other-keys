Edit history: 2004-07-20, Version 1 by Bruno Haible

Status: For CLiki consideration

Problem Description:

    (values &allow-other-keys) matches the syntax for the VALUES type specifier, but the description doesn't say what it means. Because the syntax does not allow &key, &allow-other-keys was probably a mistake.

Proposal (VALUES-&ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS:DISALLOW):

    Don't mention &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS as being allowed in the VALUES type specifier.

Test case:

Rationale:

Current practice:

    CLISP supports &KEY and &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS.

Cost to Implementors:

    None.

Cost to Users:

    None.

Cost of Non-Adoption:

    Unclear spec.

Benefits:

Aesthetics:

Discussion:

    Bruno Haible supports proposal DISALLOW.
